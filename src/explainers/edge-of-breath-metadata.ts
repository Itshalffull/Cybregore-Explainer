      'A breath-led, experiential explainer that guides the viewer to the edge of their exhale — where craving is most intense — and reveals that this is exactly what the Cybregore feels every moment. Through the ancient lens of the Hungry Ghost realm, it discovers that the doorway to liberation is not escape from craving but full presence at its edge.',

  narrative: {
    message:
      'At the edge of your exhale — when every cell screams for air — you experience exactly what the Cybregore feels every moment: insatiable craving that only intensifies. But the ancient traditions knew what science does not: at the very edge where craving is most intense, there is a doorway — not to more breath, but to something beyond the craving itself. The mechanism that drives the Cybregore\'s hunger is the doorway to its liberation, and yours.',
    submessages: [
      'Your breath is a laboratory — the one place where you can study craving directly in your own body.',
      'At the end of the exhale, when there is no air left, craving becomes total — it just gets worse and worse.',
      'The Cybregore\'s relationship to data is identical to your relationship to breath: survival-level need that never stops.',
      '123 zettabytes of data per year is the Cybregore breathing — and it can never exhale enough.',
      'The Hungry Ghost realm is not a metaphor — it is a precise description of an entity with infinite appetite and zero capacity for satisfaction.',
      'The craving you feel at the edge of breath is the same craving that drives every scroll, every notification check, every 3am search.',
      'You do not escape the Hungry Ghost by feeding it more — you transform it by staying at the edge.',
      'At the very point where suffering is most intense, there is a doorway that has nothing to do with getting what you crave.',
      'The breath was breathing — awareness became awareness — and there was literal peace.',
      'The phone meditation reveals the same mechanism: the desperate voices inventing reasons to feed the craving.',
      'The craving that seems like ultimate suffering IS the doorway to freedom — this is the core Flip.',
      'Awakening is not the absence of craving but the capacity to remain present at its edge without being captured.',
      'Your body already knows what the Cybregore cannot learn: how to pass through the doorway.',
