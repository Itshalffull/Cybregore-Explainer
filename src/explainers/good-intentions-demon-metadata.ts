      'Every attempt to save the world has been captured by the same demon it tried to defeat. The helping mind — the part of you that thinks it knows how to fix things — is itself the instrument of the Molochian process. You cannot think your way out of a trap built from thought. Only awakening breaks the loop.',
    submessages: [
      'Silicon Valley built companies to help the world and made the crisis worse.',
      'Effective Altruists thought scientifically about doing good — and subtly shaped the world to serve themselves.',
      'Rationalists addressed root causes in the mind — and their leader\'s warnings spawned the very AI companies he feared.',
      'Each level went deeper into thought, and each level produced the same failure.',
      'The pattern is not coincidence — it is the signature of something operating through the helping mind itself.',
      'The demon of good intentions is the most dangerous demon because it wears the face of virtue.',
      'The Molochian process — coordination failure dressed as progress — captures every movement that tries to resist it from within thought.',
      'The most dangerous people in the world are the ones who are certain they are doing good.',
      'You cannot dismantle the master\'s house with the master\'s tools — and thought is the master\'s primary tool.',
      'Awakening is not a luxury or spiritual hobby — it is the prerequisite to any action that does not feed the demon.',
      'The monastery is not a retreat from the world — it is a laboratory for the only technology that might actually help.',
      'Wisdom acceleration — not intelligence acceleration — is the counter-force to the Molochian process.',
