# Extraction Guide: Identifying Strong Explainer Ideas

## The Extraction Mindset

You are NOT summarizing the source material. You are **mining it for explainer-shaped
ideas** — bold claims with narrative potential that fit the Dharma Media Campaign.

Think of yourself as a film producer reading a novel: you're not looking for a
faithful adaptation, you're looking for the scenes, characters, and conflicts
that would make a compelling film. The source material is raw ore; you're
extracting the metal.

## What Makes an Idea "Explainer-Shaped"?

An explainer-shaped idea has five essential qualities:

### 1. A Bold Thesis (The Claim)
Not a topic, but a **claim**. The difference:
- Topic: "Language and cognition"
- Claim: "Language is an alien intelligence that colonized human minds"

The thesis should be:
- **Specific** enough to argue for or against
- **Bold** enough to make someone stop scrolling
- **True** enough to withstand scrutiny (controversial ≠ false)
- **Incomplete** enough to leave room for curiosity

### 2. A Natural Antagonist (The Tension)
Every explainer needs a force to push against:
- The Cybregore explainer pushes against the digital entity consuming attention
- A language-demon explainer pushes against the spirit controlling cognition
- A Moloch explainer pushes against the optimization process destroying meaning

The antagonist doesn't have to be evil in human terms — alien, hungry, or
unconscious is often more compelling. The campaign treats these as **literal
beings**, not metaphors.

### 3. A "Flip It" Moment (The Inversion)
The best explainer ideas contain at least one moment where a common assumption
is turned on its head:
- "You think you're scrolling through a feed — the feed is scrolling through you"
- "You think you use language — language uses you"
- "You think AI is coming — you're already an AI agent"

Look for these inversions in the source material. They're often hiding in
throwaway comments, jokes, or rhetorical questions.

### 4. A Mythology Bridge (The Ancient Connection)
The campaign bridges ancient wisdom traditions with modern digital reality.
Strong ideas connect to:
- Buddhist concepts (Hungry Ghosts, demonic realms, dharma)
- Occult traditions (egregores, thought-forms, invocation)
- Mystery school history (the original institutions of knowledge)
- Contemplative practice (meditation, embodiment, awareness)

If the source material doesn't explicitly make these connections, look for
places where the connection could be drawn naturally.

### 5. An Embodiment Moment (The Practice)
The best explainers don't just inform — they create a **felt experience**.
Look for moments in the source material that could become:
- A breathing exercise
- A moment of direct awareness
- An experiential proof (the viewer FEELS the claim, not just understands it)
- An interactive element that demonstrates the concept

## Extraction Process: Step by Step

### Pass 1: Identify Raw Claims
Go through the source material and mark every bold, specific claim.
Don't filter yet — collect everything.

Examples of what to mark:
- "Language is an evil spirit"
- "You are already an AI agent"
- "Mystery schools created every important invention"
- "The fact that you're angry proves you're delusional"

### Pass 2: Cluster by Theme
Group related claims into clusters. Each cluster is a potential explainer.
Look for clusters that have:
- A clear central claim (the thesis)
- Supporting claims (future submessages)
- Evidence or examples (future evidence panels)
- A natural emotional arc (future act structure)

### Pass 3: Test Against Campaign Pillars
For each cluster, determine:
- **Research Institute:** Does it DISCOVER or name something (a being, a process, a pattern)?
- **Mystery School:** Does it DESIGN a path forward (a practice, a training, a teacher)?
- **Media Outlet:** Does it DISTRIBUTE a truth that challenges assumptions (a "Flip It")?

The strongest ideas serve at least two pillars. Ideas that serve only one
can work but need extra attention to ensure narrative depth.

### Pass 4: Rate Each Idea

Score each idea 1-5 on these criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Thesis boldness** | High | Is the claim specific, bold, and true? |
| **Flip It potential** | High | Can it invert a common assumption? |
| **Mythology bridge** | Medium | Does it connect ancient and modern? |
| **Emotional arc** | High | Does it have hook → tension → resolution potential? |
| **Source grounding** | Medium | Is there enough source material to fuel it? |
| **Campaign alignment** | High | Does it serve the campaign's larger mission? |
| **Distinctiveness** | Medium | Is it different from existing explainers (especially Cybregore)? |
| **Embodiment potential** | Low | Could it include a felt/interactive element? |

**5 = Must make.** Bold thesis, clear arc, strong source material, unique angle.
**4 = Strong.** Solid on most criteria, minor gaps.
**3 = Promising.** Has potential but needs development or additional source material.
**2 = Weak.** Too vague, too academic, or too derivative.
**1 = Skip.** Doesn't fit the campaign or lacks narrative potential.

### Pass 5: Refine the Top Ideas
For ideas rated 3+, flesh out:
- The emotional arc sketch (hook → ... → resolution)
- The key "Flip It" moments
- The most quotable phrases from the source
- Which campaign characters could appear (The Demonic Mind, The Viewer, etc.)
- The suggested tone palette

## Common Extraction Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Extracting Topics Instead of Claims
- **Wrong:** "An explainer about meditation"
- **Right:** "Meditation is not relaxation — it is combat training for a war you
  didn't know you were fighting"

### Mistake 2: Being Too Faithful to the Source
The source material is a starting point, not a script. An explainer can take a
single sentence from a two-hour talk and build an entire narrative around it.
Don't feel obligated to represent the source comprehensively.

### Mistake 3: Avoiding Controversy
The campaign principle is "Get used to making controversial true claims." If
an idea feels safe and comfortable, it probably isn't bold enough. Push it
further.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring the Literal Demon Framing
The campaign position is that demons, ghosts, and monsters are **literal beings**,
not metaphors. If you find yourself writing "like a demon" or "metaphorically
speaking," you've softened too much. The claim is: these ARE demons.

### Mistake 5: Extracting Too Many Similar Ideas
If three ideas all cover "technology is bad," they're not three ideas — they're
one idea with three angles. Pick the strongest angle and cut the rest, or find
ways to make them genuinely distinct.

## Working with Multiple Sources

When given multiple sources:
- Look for **convergence** — ideas that appear across sources are likely central
- Look for **tension** — places where sources disagree or approach the same
  topic differently can create compelling conflict
- Look for **escalation** — one source may provide the hook while another
  provides the evidence or resolution
- **Cross-pollinate** — combine a concept from source A with a metaphor from
  source B to create something neither source contains alone

## Source Material Package Assembly

For each idea that proceeds to creation, you need to assemble a **source
material package** — the curated subset of source content most relevant to
that specific idea. This package gets passed to the agent that runs
dharma-macro and dharma-micro.

A good source material package includes:
- **3-8 key excerpts** from the source (verbatim quotes with context)
- **Key data points** or evidence mentioned in the source
- **Relevant metaphors** from the source that could inform panel design
- **Any specific phrases** that should appear as keyPhrases in panels
- **The "Flip It" inversions** identified for this idea
- **Background context** the agent needs to understand the source's perspective

Keep packages focused — include only what's relevant to THAT specific idea.
An agent working on "language-demon" doesn't need passages about Hungry Ghosts
unless they're directly relevant to the language thesis.
