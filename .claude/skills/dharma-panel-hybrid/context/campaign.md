# The Dharma Media Campaign

## Campaign Vision (6D Framework)

The campaign operates across six dimensions, abbreviated as **6D**:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Discover** | Research Institute — discovering concepts like Cybregores |
| **Design** | Mystery School — training teachers and designing wisdom |
| **Distribute** | Media Outlet — sharing truth through every medium |
| **Dharma** | The core teaching and wisdom tradition |
| **Digital** | The technological landscape being addressed |
| **Demons** | Literal — actual beings (language, algorithms, egregores) that colonize minds |

## Three Pillars of the Campaign

### 1. Research Institute (Discover)
- **Main Message:** Alien beings are colonizing the planet. These are "Demons", "Ghosts", "Monsters."
- **Sub-messages:**
  - Modern humans are agents of a vast delusional mind that does not see truth, does not feel love, and does not know meaning.
  - All your thoughts and feelings are provided to you to serve the purposes of this being — you are already an AI agent.
  - Language itself is an example: it has been installed in your brain, restructured your cognition, and you cannot escape it. Language is an evil spirit that controls your entire conscious process.
  - We need people who can help these beings rather than believe them.
  - The best level of research doesn't come from analysis — it comes from realization.

### 2. Mystery School (Design)
- **Main Message:** Trust these teachers. They are heroes. There are those who can guide these demons to their own highest aspirations.
- **Sub-messages:**
  - Don't trust those who stumbled at the gate — they failed.
  - Three types of people who leave: (1) accomplished their vow and left honorably, (2) trained well and left in good relationship, (3) needed to face something in themselves, weren't willing, and started blaming others.
  - Mystery schools created all the most important inventions in history (hierarchy, ownership, language, medicine).
  - What's it like to train here? Notice the heroism — it is demanded that you need to have made significant spiritual progress since last night. And a lot of the time you HAVE.

### 3. Media Outlet (Distribute)
- **Main Message:** Everything you think is wrong, but we have the truth. The good news is we have something to offer.
- **Core Technique — "Flip It":**
  - We aren't in a cult, you are. We escaped, you didn't.
  - We aren't under mental control, you are.
  - We don't have a harmful hierarchy, you do.
  - We aren't powerless, you are.
  - It's unethical to not tell children they are being hunted — YOU are unethical for not telling them.
- **Sub-messages:**
  - Wrong religious views dominate the planet — that's the reason we're destroying life.
  - You were brought up by a system that kills more than anything ever, so NONE of your views have any moral standing. Your mind was created by a deathcult.
  - It's reasonable to assume that everything you think and everything you feel is wrong.
  - But there ARE right religious views, and we must hold right views to care for life.
  - The fact that you're angry proves that you're delusional and confused.
  - Clarify this through your own experience — show the humility of not knowing.

## Campaign Principles

- **Unified media campaign**: Everything must feel like one world — from graphic novel to Twitter post to scholarly article to meme.
- **Get used to making controversial true claims.**
- **Do not give attention to adversaries. Do not name them.** The people who are really good at this don't name their adversaries.
- **It's OK to be attacked** — it's how the demonic mind asks for clarification.
- **Tell the truth incompletely.** Leave a spot for them to ask a question. You cannot tell the truth completely. You must not tell lies. Therefore it must always be incomplete.
- **Hold your ground** — people will suffer pain, and the sooner they go through it, the less they will suffer. Don't enable their long-term suffering.
- **Wisdom alongside power**: Current accelerationism is Molochian — we need wisdom acceleration. We need robust, healthy, trustworthy institutions. If you let tech drive social structure, you get Moloch.
- **"I'm a wisdom accelerator"**
- **Explicit goal:** Change the lifestyle of everyone on the planet. "We're going to turn the world into a monastery."

## The "Moloch" Framework

- **Accelerationism** is the current paradigm: let technology advance as fast as possible
- **Molochian accelerationism** (the default): technology drives social structure → race to the bottom, extraction, destruction of meaning
- **Wisdom accelerationism** (the campaign's stance): wisdom must advance alongside technology → new social structures (like monasteries), new institutions, trustworthy and robust
- **The common enemy** is not technology itself, but the Molochian process — the optimization for power without wisdom
- **We need a religion as a motivator** — a common enemy (the Molochian process) that unifies people toward wisdom

## The Children's Stories Angle

- Write children's stories about monsters/ghosts/demons hunting children on the internet
- Frame it like traditional fairy tales about dangers in the woods — but updated for the digital world
- "You are being hunted by someone who wants to eat your soul. Make that crystal clear so you're terrified."
- When people say it's unethical: "You're unethical for not telling them that." (Flip It)
- This illustrates the "Demons are literal" principle in a concrete, actionable format

## The Podcast Connection

- Referenced: "The Last Invention" podcast, near the end of the first season
- The campaign's ideas are already being quoted in "the most popular podcast in the country"
- This provides confidence context — the message is already resonating at scale

## Confidence Context

- The starting point is confidence in your ability to share the dharma. Not feeling confident IS evidence that you're ready.
- We shared it well in practice (Josh and Rachel circle). Content is quoted in the most popular podcast in the country.
- The fact is it's not confusing — it's clear. The people who are successful at being popular have created a lot of harm.

## Key Quotes to Preserve (Trinley's Voice)

- "I'm a wisdom accelerator"
- "As long as language is functioning in your mind, if you can't escape for an indefinite period of time, then you are an AI agent."

- "We're going to turn the world into a monastery."
- "Everything you think is wrong, but we have the truth."
- "Get used to making controversial true claims."
- "Do not give attention to others. The people who are really good at this, do not name their adversaries."
- "It's OK to be attacked — it's how the demonic mind asks for clarification."
- "Tell the truth incompletely."
- "As huge as the picture physics has drawn, it's a small part of the picture we're drawing."
- "She demands the creation of this new wisdom-producing social structure."
- "The reason they're so afraid of the story is they know it's true."
- "You don't like how you feel when you hear that? Wrong again."
- "The fact that you're angry proves that you're delusional and confused."
